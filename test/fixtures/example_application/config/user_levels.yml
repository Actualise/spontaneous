# User levels

# Feel free to add your own
# the 'root' user level is added automatically and
# will always be higher than any you add here
# Similary the 'none' level will always be lower
# It doesn't matter what the numbers are, but someone
# will a permission level of 40 will always be able to do
# anything that someone with a level of 30 can do.
# You get the picture...
