Spontaneous is a revolutionary new content management system that brings the best of Ruby and the best of HTML5 together in one elegant package.

This is version 2 of an existing (closed source) CMS that has been in active production use for over 6 years. For more information about that, and to see the sites that it powers, please go to [magnetised's homepage](http://magnetised.info/).
